Turn the dough onto a clean surface, form into a disc, and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30-60 minutes.\n 1: Preheat the oven to 375\u02daF (190\u02daC). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n 2: While the dough is resting, make the filling: Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the garlic cloves to a large, high-walled skillet over medium heat. Cook for 3 minutes, until the garlic just begins to brown. Add the onion and \u00bd teaspoon of salt. Cook for 20-25 minutes, until the onion is caramelized. Remove from the pan and set aside to cool in a bowl. To the same pan, add the potatoes, \u00bd teaspoon of salt, and the water. Increase the heat to medium-high, cover, and cook for 3-5 minutes, until the potatoes are almost fully cooked and the water is nearly evaporated. Remove the lid and cook for 2 minutes more to completely evaporate the water. Remove potatoes from the pan and set aside to cool.\n 3: To the same pan, add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, the red pepper flakes, and chard stems. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3 minutes, until the stems are softened. Add the chard leaves and remaining \u00bd teaspoon of salt and cook for 5 minutes, until wilted and reduced in volume by half. Remove the pan from the heat.\n 4: Remove the garlic cloves from the caramelized onions and transfer to a small bowl. Mash with the back of a fork, then add to the softened goat cheese and stir to combine.\n 5: Stir the onions into the pan with the saut\u00e9ed chard.\n 6: Assemble the crostata: Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch (30 cm) wide circle, about \u215b inch (3 mm) thick. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet.\n 7: Spread \u00bd cup (110 G) of the garlic goat cheese over the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch (50 cm) border around the edges. Arrange half of the potatoes, slightly overlapping, over the goat cheese, then top with half of the Swiss chard and onion mixture. Repeat with remaining potatoes and chard mixture.\n 8: Fold the edges of the crust up and over the filling to create a rustic look. Brush the crust with the beaten egg. Top with dollops of the remaining goat cheese.\n 9: Bake the crostata for 45-50 minutes, until the crust is golden brown.\n 10: Let cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.\n 11: Enjoy!"}]}

Sift the almond flour mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl.\n 1: In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites and the remaining \u00bd teaspoon of salt on medium-high with an electric hand mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until soft peaks form. Gradually add the granulated sugar until fully incorporated. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form (you should be able to turn the bowl upside down without anything falling out).\n 2: Add the vanilla and golden yellow gel food coloring and beat until just combined.\n 3: Add about \u2153 of the sifted almond flour mixture at a time to the beaten egg whites and use a spatula to gently fold until combined. After the last addition of almond flour, continue to fold slowly until the batter falls into ribbons with jagged edges and you can make a figure 8 while holding the spatula up. Transfer the macaron batter to a piping bag fitted with a medium round (#12) tip.\n 4: Grease 2 rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray and place a piece of parchment paper over each sheet, using the spray to help adhere the parchment to the pans.\n 5: Pipe the macarons onto the parchment paper in 2\u00bd-inch (6\u00bc-cm) circles, spacing at least 1 inch (2 cm) apart. You should have 8 per pan. Tap the baking sheets on a flat surface 5 times to release any air bubbles.\n 6: Let the macarons sit at room temperature for 1\u20132 hours, until dry to the touch.\n 7: Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C).\n 8: Bake the macarons for 27\u201330 minutes, until the feet are well-risen and the macarons don\u2019t stick to the parchment paper when lifted. Transfer the macarons to a wire rack to cool completely before filling.\n 9: Make the buttercream: Microwave the maple syrup in a medium heat-proof glass bowl for 90 seconds on high power. Let the syrup cool for at least 20 minutes, until warm but not hot. Warning: the syrup and bowl will be very hot; use caution.\n 10: In a large bowl, cream the butter with an electric hand mixer on high speed for 1 minute, until light and fluffy. Sift in the powdered sugar and beat until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla and beat to combine. Add the cream and beat to incorporate.\n 11: Add the cooled maple syrup to the buttercream and beat on high speed until smooth, scraping the sides as needed. Note: If the syrup has cooled to the point of hardening, microwave in 5-second intervals until pourable.\n 12: Transfer 1 tablespoon of the buttercream to a small bowl. Add the yellow gel food coloring and stir until combined. Spread the yellow buttercream in a thin, even layer, about 2\u00bd inches square, on a piece of parchment paper. Cover with another piece of parchment paper and smooth. Transfer to the freezer until ready to assemble the macarons.\n 13: Transfer \u2154 cup of the maple buttercream to a medium bowl. Add the brown gel food coloring and stir until combined.\n 14: Transfer \u00bc cup of the remaining uncolored maple buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a small open star (#14) tip. Transfer the remaining uncolored buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a medium round (#12) tip. Set aside.\n 15: Spread about 1 teaspoon of brown buttercream onto the rounded tops of half of the macaron shells, leaving a \u00bc inch border around the edges. Use a clean paintbrush to carefully (the macaron shells are fragile) clean up the edges of the buttercream.\n 16: Use the maple buttercream in the piping bag fitted with the round tip to pipe a thin swirl of buttercream on the rounded tops of the remaining macaron shells, leaving at least a \u00bd inch border around the edges.\n 17: Place a brown-painted macaron shell on top of each buttercream-frosted macaron shell.\n 18: Place the macarons in an airtight container for 24 hours to \u201cbloom,\u201d prior to decorating, if desired.\n 19: To decorate, use the maple buttercream in the piping bag fitted with the round tip to pipe about 2 teaspoons of buttercream on top of 4 macaron stacks to look like whipped cream. Use the tip of a butter knife to make a small well in the center of the buttercream. Scoop about 1 teaspoon of blueberry jam into each well. Use the tip of the knife to help the jam flow over the edges of the \u201cwhipped cream.\u201d\n 20: Remove the yellow buttercream sheet from the freezer. Peel off the top layer of parchment. Use a sharp knife to cut the buttercream into 12 squares (they will be fragile). Run a butter knife under the squares to release from the parchment and use the flat side of the knife to transfer 2 butter pats to the top of each of the remaining 4 macaron stacks (don\u2019t use your fingers; the buttercream will soften quickly.) Use the maple buttercream in the piping bag fitted with the open star tip to pipe \u201cwhipped cream\u201d next to the butter pats. Sprinkle each stack with \u00bd teaspoon mini chocolate chips. Note: If chocolate chips aren\u2019t sticking to the macarons, apply a small dot of buttercream on the bottom of each chip.\n 21: When ready to serve, transfer the macarons on a serving platter and pour maple syrup over the top.\n 22: Enjoy!"}]}

Mix on medium speed until the dough comes together in a ball and begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes.\n 1: Use wet hands to wipe the dough from the hook and cover the bowl with a kitchen towel. Place the dough in a warm place and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.\n 2: Line a 9 x 13-inch baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease with nonstick spray.\n 3: Uncover the bowl and transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Use your hands to gently press the dough to the edges of the pan. Refrigerate until the dough is completely chilled all the way through, at least 1 hour, or up to 8 hours. If refrigerating for more than 1 hour, cover with plastic wrap to prevent the dough from drying out.\n 4: Make the butter block: Cut a sheet of parchment paper to measure 12 x 16 inches. Fold the edges inward to create a 7-inch square, then unfold the parchment.\n 5: Slice the butter lengthwise into \u00bc-inch-thick pieces and arrange the butter tiles in a single layer to fill the center 7-inch square of the parchment. Fold the parchment over to fully enclose the butter and let the packet sit at room temperature until slightly softened, about 30 minutes. When the butter is malleable, use a rolling pin to distribute the butter in an even layer to the edges and corners of the packet. If the butter is too soft, refrigerate the packet until it firms up, about 20 minutes.  You want the butter and the dough to have the same texture.\n 6: Laminate the dough: Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a very lightly floured work surface (too much flour will break the lamination, so use just enough to keep the dough from sticking to the work surface). Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a rectangle that is a little more than twice as long as the butter block, about 8 x 15 inches.  Place the butter block in the center of the dough and fold the sides of the dough over the butter to completely encase the block, gently pressing the dough together to seal.\n 7: Very lightly dust the rolling pin with flour and roll the dough into a square, about \u00bc inch thick.  Use a pastry wheel or long, sharp knife to trim the edges so the butter is just barely exposed on all sides (trimming the edges will help make clean and even layers when folding the dough). Fold the dough in half horizontally, then fold in half vertically, making sure to line up the edges. Place the dough square back on the baking sheet and let the dough rest in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.\n 8: Remove the dough from the refrigerator and repeat rolling out to \u00bc-inch-thick square, trimming the edges, and folding one more time. Return the dough to the baking sheet and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Place the dough in the refrigerator and let rest overnight.\n 9: Shape the donuts: Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.\n 10: Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature until it is soft enough to roll without applying too much pressure, about 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a very lightly floured surface and roll into a 14-inch square. Let the dough rest for about 5 minutes to let the gluten relax.\n 11: Using a 3\u00bd-inch round cutter, cut out 12 rounds from the dough. Use a 1-inch round cutter to cut out the center of each dough round. Place the donuts on the prepared baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart. Lightly grease a piece of plastic wrap with nonstick spray and gently cover the pan. Let the donuts proof at room temperature until doubled in size, about 2 hours.\n 12: Fry the donuts: Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot fitted with a deep fry thermometer over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Set a wire rack over a baking sheet.\n 13: Working in batches of 3\u20134 at a time, fry the donuts in the hot oil, flipping once halfway through, until golden brown all over, about 3 minutes. Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the donuts to the wire rack to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.\n 14: Make the icing: In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla bean seeds, and buttermilk until smooth. Transfer the icing to a small piping bag and cut a hole in the tip.\n 15: Pipe the icing on the top of the donuts.\n 16: Enjoy!"}]}

(The dough should be malleable, but not sticky--add more flour if the dough is sticking too much to your hands or the surface. Alternatively, if it\u2019s too dry and tough, whisk another egg with 1 tablespoon of water and use your hand to sprinkle some of the mixture over the dough, continuing to do so until the dough is easier to knead.)\n 4: Knead the dough for 7-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. When you poke the dough, it should spring back.\n 5: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour, or until the dough does not spring back when poked.\n 6: Unwrap the dough and cut into 8 equal pieces so that it\u2019s easier to work with. Take 1 piece and wrap the rest in the plastic wrap so that they don\u2019t dry out.\n 7: Lightly flour your work surface, and begin rolling out the piece of dough into one long piece. Then, fold the top third down, and the bottom third over that, like a letter. Rotate the dough 90\u02da and roll the piece back into a long shape. This helps form a more even rectangular shape and makes the dough a little bit easier to work with.\n 8: Continue rolling out the dough until it is very thin. When you lift the dough, you should be able to see your hands through it.\n 9: Fold the top and bottom of the rectangle to meet in the middle, then fold over again--this will make the dough easier to cut. Cut the dough to your ideal shape. Loosen or unravel the cut dough immediately, so it doesn\u2019t stick, sprinkle with a bit of extra flour, or semolina, if using. Let the pasta sit out for about 30 minutes to dry out slightly.\n 10: Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and stir to ensure it doesn\u2019t clump. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or 30 seconds to 1 minute after the pasta comes to the surface (fresh pasta will cook much faster than dried pasta!)\n 11: Take out a noodle and taste for doneness. Once cooked to your liking, remove the pasta from the water, being sure to save at least 1 cup (240 ML) of the pasta cooking water.\n 12: Add the cooked pasta into your preferred sauce and stir to coat, adding some of the reserved pasta water if needed to add a bit of body and silkiness to the sauce.\n 13: Enjoy!"}]}

Place the wrapped turkey on a baking sheet and set on the bottom shelf of the fridge. Defrost for 1 day if fresh, or 4-5 days, if frozen. For a quicker defrost, submerge the turkey in a large sink or cooler filled with cold water and defrost for 30 minutes per pound of turkey.\n 1: 1 day before cooking, brine the turkey. Measure the salt into a small bowl. Set up your work station with kitchen shears, a plastic bag, a fresh baking sheet with a wire rack set over it, and a garbage can nearby.\n 2: Cut the packaging off the defrosted turkey, being careful not to cut the skin or flesh, and remove from the bag. Set the turkey on the baking sheet with the wire rack. Cut off any excess skin around the neck and release the plastic holder securing the legs. Remove any innards and giblets from the cavity and discard. Thoroughly pat the turkey dry with paper towels.\n 3: Sprinkle the salt all over the turkey, making sure to get in the cavity, under the skin, and between any crevices.\n 4: Refrigerate the turkey, uncovered, for 1 day. If brining for more than 1 day, cover the turkey with plastic wrap, then remove for the last day to let the skin dry out before roasting.\n 5: A few hours before serving, prepare the turkey for roasting. Set an oven rack at the lowest height and the other in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 325\u02daF (160\u02daC).\n 6: Add the butter to a medium bowl. Chop the sage leaves and add to the bowl, along with the garlic, thyme, and rosemary. Mash the herbs into the butter. Set aside.\n 7: Set a roasting pan or single-use aluminum pan over a baking sheet near your work station.\n 8: Trim off the wing tips of the turkey and add to the roasting pan. Cut off any excess skin to expose the wishbone, then use a paring knife to cut out the bone. Use your hands or kitchen shears if the bone is hard to remove. Add to the roasting pan.\n 9: Turn the bird so the legs are facing you. Tug out the plastic holder. Loosen the skin around the breasts, using your fingers to create a pocket. Be careful not to tear the skin. Rub the herb butter under the skin, then all over the rest of the turkey. Make sure to get in any crevices and the cavity.\n 10: Stuff the lemon wedges and \u00bc of the onion inside the turkey cavity. Add the rest of the onion wedges to the roasting pan, along with the carrot and celery. Pour the chicken broth into the pan.\n 11: Use the wire rack to rest the turkey over the roasting pan, then pour any accumulated juices from the baking sheet into the pan.\n 12: Set the roasting pan on the lowest oven rack. Place the turkey on the wire rack on the middle oven rack, directly over the roasting pan to catch any juices.\n 13: Roast the turkey for about 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 160\u02daF (71\u02daC). Start checking the turkey about 90 minutes into roasting to ensure it does not overcook.\n 14: Remove the turkey from the oven and set the wire rack over a baking sheet to catch any juices. Let rest for about 30 minutes while the internal temperature climbs to 165\u02daF (74\u02daC).\n 15: Meanwhile, make the gravy: Remove any solids from the roasting pan. Strain the liquid into a large pot and bring to a boil, then let reduce to your desired consistency. The gravy can be served as is or, for a thicker gravy, ladle a few spoonfuls of stock into a small bowl with the flour. Whisk until no lumps remain, then stir a bit of the flour mixture at a time back into the pot. Return to a boil and let cook for 5 minutes, until thickened. Repeat as needed until the gravy has reached your desired consistency. Reduce the heat to low, whisking occasionally, until ready to serve, or remove from the heat and bring back to temperature before serving.\n 16: Carve the turkey: Transfer the turkey to a large cutting board with a lip to catch any juices. First, release the legs to make carving the rest of the bird easier. Using a sharp knife, cut along where the legs meets the breasts, being careful not to cut all the way through. Then, use your hands to pull the legs and thigh away from the carcass and tuck them under the wings to keep them in place.\n 17: Cut straight down along both sides of the breast bone until you can\u2019t cut any further, then cut horizontally near the wing to release the breasts from the carcass.\n 18: Cut all the way through the legs to release from the hip joint.\n 19: Find where the shoulder meets the breast, then cut through that joint to remove the wings, using your hands to pull the wing away if the joint is tough to find.\n 20: Set the carcass aside--you can pick off any remaining meat for leftovers, or make stock from the whole carcass.\n 21: Slice the breasts crosswise, against the grain, then transfer to a serving platter. Cut the drumsticks from the thighs through the joint, wiggling the knife to find an easy release or pulling apart with your hands. Add the drumsticks to the platter. Cut the thigh meat away from the bone, then into bite-size pieces, and add to the platter. Release the flats from the wings by cutting through the joint, pulling apart with your hands if necessary, then add to the platter.\n 22: Rearrange the meat on the platter so the larger pieces of meat with crispy, browned skin are on top. Garnish the platter with sage leaves and lemon wedges, if desired.\n 23: Serve with the warm gravy.\n 24: Enjoy!"}]}
