Let sit for 5 minutes, until the yeast has bloomed. 1: NOTE: It may be tempting to use all whole wheat flour in this recipe, but, in our testing, that method resulted in dense, tough, squat breads that barely rose when we tried to proof them.  Using some all-purpose flour was necessary to give us the rise and soft, pillowy texture we wanted in a good sandwich bread. 2: Pour in the wheat flour, all-purpose flour, oil, and salt, and mix until the dough comes together in a ball that does not stick to your fingers. 3: NOTE: You can also do the first 2 steps in a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, mixing on low speed until the dough no longer sticks to the sides. 4: On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough a few times until it really starts to form a tight ball. 5: Form the dough into a ball shape and transfer to a greased bowl, turning the dough to coat it in grease. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a wet towel and store in a warm place for 1 hour. 6: Allow the dough to proof until it has doubled in size. Save the plastic wrap or towel as you’ll be using it again. 7: Transfer the proofed dough to a lightly floured surface and press the dough – don’t stretch – into a 7x7-inch (18x18 cm) square. 8: Fold the top 3rd of the square down, and the bottom 3rd up to form an even rectangle. Pinch the top fold to seal the dough. 9: Roll the dough over so that the seal faces upward and fold both ends up toward the center, so that the dough has formed an even log shape about the size of your loaf pan. 10: Transfer the dough to a greased loaf pan and cover with with the same plastic wrap or towel used before. 11: Let the dough rise for 1 hour, until it has poofed over the edge of the loaf pan about 1½ inches (4 cm). 12: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). 13: Remove the plastic wrap or towel and transfer to the oven and bake for 50-55 minutes, until the dough has browned slightly and formed a light brown crust. 14: Immediately remove the loaf from the pan and set aside to cool for at least 1 hour before slicing. 15: Store in an airtight container or bag. The bread can be stored in freezer up to 6 months. 16: Enjoy!

Use a wire whisk or fork to beat until the whites and the yolks are completely combined, with no spots of egg white remaining. The mixture should flow off the whisk evenly. Let sit at room temperature for 10–15 minutes. 1: Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until it starts to foam, but does not brown, about 1 minute. Pour in the eggs. Using a rubber spatula, constantly scrape the bottom of the pan while also moving it in a circular motion to ensure that the eggs cook slowly, forming only small curds, 1–2 minutes. Be sure to scrape the sides of the pan to incorporate the wispy edges back into the center of the omelette. Once the eggs are softly scrambled and look creamy and custardy, 2–3 minutes more, stop stirring and reduce the heat to low. Use the spatula to smooth the surface in an even layer. You can also gently shake the skillet to settle any uncooked egg. The surface should look wet, but not runny. 2: Remove the pan from the heat and let sit for 1 minute to ensure the omelette will hold its shape. 3: Gently begin to roll up one side of the omelette. Slide ½ tablespoon of butter into the pan to help release the rest of the omelette from the surface. Continue rolling into a cylinder shape, then invert onto a plate, seam-side down. 4: Brush the exterior of the omelette with the remaining ½ tablespoon butter.

"answer: name: pancake-macarons. ingredients:powdered sugar (1 ¾cups)、almond flour (1cup)、kosher salt (1teaspoon)、large egg whites、granulated sugar (¼cup)、vanilla extract (½teaspoon)、golden yellow gel food coloring、nonstick cooking spray . instructions: 0: Make the macarons: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the powdered sugar, almond flour, and ½ teaspoon of salt and process on low speed, until extra-fine. Sift the almond flour mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. 1: In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites and the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt on medium-high with an electric hand mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until soft peaks form. Gradually add the granulated sugar until fully incorporated. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form (you should be able to turn the bowl upside down without anything falling out). 2: Add the vanilla and golden yellow gel food coloring and beat until just combined. 3: Add about ⅓ of the sifted almond flour mixture at a time to the beaten egg whites and use a spatula to gently fold until combined. After the last addition of almond flour, continue to fold slowly until the batter falls into ribbons with jagged edges and you can make a figure 8 while holding the spatula up. Transfer the macaron batter to a piping bag fitted with a medium round (#12) tip. 4: Grease 2 rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray and place a piece of parchment paper over each sheet, using the spray to help adhere the parchment to the pans. 5: Pipe the macarons onto the parchment paper in 2½-inch (6¼-cm) circles, spacing at least 1 inch (2 cm) apart. You should have 8 per pan. Tap the baking sheets on a flat surface 5 times to release any air bubbles. 6: Let the macarons sit at room temperature for 1–2 hours, until dry to the touch. 7: Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). 8: Bake the macarons for 27–30 minutes, until the feet are well-risen and the macarons don’t stick to the parchment paper when lifted. Transfer the macarons to a wire rack to cool completely before filling. 9: Make the buttercream: Microwave the maple syrup in a medium heat-proof glass bowl for 90 seconds on high power. Let the syrup cool for at least 20 minutes, until warm but not hot. Warning: the syrup and bowl will be very hot; use caution. 10: In a large bowl, cream the butter with an electric hand mixer on high speed for 1 minute, until light and fluffy. Sift in the powdered sugar and beat until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla and beat to combine. Add the cream and beat to incorporate. 11: Add the cooled maple syrup to the buttercream and beat on high speed until smooth, scraping the sides as needed. Note: If the syrup has cooled to the point of hardening, microwave in 5-second intervals until pourable. 12: Transfer 1 tablespoon of the buttercream to a small bowl. Add the yellow gel food coloring and stir until combined. Spread the yellow buttercream in a thin, even layer, about 2½ inches square, on a piece of parchment paper. Cover with another piece of parchment paper and smooth. Transfer to the freezer until ready to assemble the macarons. 13: Transfer ⅔ cup of the maple buttercream to a medium bowl. Add the brown gel food coloring and stir until combined. 14: Transfer ¼ cup of the remaining uncolored maple buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a small open star (#14) tip. Transfer the remaining uncolored buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a medium round (#12) tip. Set aside. 15: Spread about 1 teaspoon of brown buttercream onto the rounded tops of half of the macaron shells, leaving a ¼ inch border around the edges. Use a clean paintbrush to carefully (the macaron shells are fragile) clean up the edges of the buttercream. 16: Use the maple buttercream in the piping bag fitted with the round tip to pipe a thin swirl of buttercream on the rounded tops of the remaining macaron shells, leaving at least a ½ inch border around the edges. 17: Place a brown-painted macaron shell on top of each buttercream-frosted macaron shell. 18: Place the macarons in an airtight container for 24 hours to “bloom,” prior to decorating, if desired. 19: To decorate, use the maple buttercream in the piping bag fitted with the round tip to pipe about 2 teaspoons of buttercream on top of 4 macaron stacks to look like whipped cream. Use the tip of a butter knife to make a small well in the center of the buttercream. Scoop about 1 teaspoon of blueberry jam into each well. Use the tip of the knife to help the jam flow over the edges of the “whipped cream.” 20: Remove the yellow buttercream sheet from the freezer. Peel off the top layer of parchment. Use a sharp knife to cut the buttercream into 12 squares (they will be fragile). Run a butter knife under the squares to release from the parchment and use the flat side of the knife to transfer 2 butter pats to the top of each of the remaining 4 macaron stacks (don’t use your fingers; the buttercream will soften quickly.) Use the maple buttercream in the piping bag fitted with the open star tip to pipe “whipped cream” next to the butter pats. Sprinkle each stack with ½ teaspoon mini chocolate chips. Note: If chocolate chips aren’t sticking to the macarons, apply a small dot of buttercream on the bottom of each chip. 21: When ready to serve, transfer the macarons on a serving platter and pour maple syrup over the top. 22: Enjoy!

"answer: name: berry-almond-morning-buns. ingredients:fresh berries (2cups)、water (1teaspoon)、granulated sugar (2tablespoons)、vanilla extract (1teaspoon) . instructions: 0: Make the berry compote: Add the berries and water to a small saucepan over medium heat. Once bubbling, reduce the heat to medium-low and use a wooden spoon to muddle and mash the fruit. Continue cooking for 10–12 minutes, occasionally stirring and mashing the berries, until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the sugar and vanilla. Transfer the compote to a heat-proof container and let cool completely, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour. 1: Make the almond paste: Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). 2: Spread the sliced almonds in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast for about 5 minutes, or until the almonds just begin to turn golden brown. 3: In a food processor, combine the toasted almonds, flour, brown sugar, and salt. Pulse until the almonds break down to medium crumbs. Add the butter and process until a smooth paste forms. Add the egg and vanilla and continue to process until the egg is fully incorporated. Transfer the almond paste to a small bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 1 week. 4: Make the dough: Add the warm milk to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and sprinkle the yeast on top. Let sit for about 3 minutes, until the mixture is frothy. 5: Add the eggs, melted butter, salt, and brown sugar and mix on medium-low speed to combine. Add the flour and mix on low speed until combined. Turn off the mixer and let the dough rest for 5 minutes. 6: After resting, scrape the dough off the paddle attachment and attach the dough hook to the mixer. Mix on medium speed for 3 minutes, adding up to ½ cup more flour if needed to form a smooth and elastic dough. The dough should not be sticky, but may still stick to the sides of the bowl slightly. 7: Grease a large bowl with nonstick spray. Transfer the dough to the bowl and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let rise at room temperature for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. 8: Turn out the dough onto a generously floured surface and flour a rolling pin. Roll the dough out to a roughly 18 × 14-inch rectangle. Spread the almond paste over the dough, all the way to the edges. Top with the berry compote, spreading evenly. Starting from a long end, roll the dough up tightly. Transfer the roll to the refrigerator for 30 minutes (this will make cutting easier). 9: Use a serrated knife to cut the dough roll into even 9 pieces, then transfer to an 8-inch square baking dish. Cover the pan with a kitchen towel and let the rolls rise for about 30 minutes, or until expanded slightly. 10: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). 11: Add the heavy cream to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for about 30 seconds, until warm, but not scalding. 12: Once the rolls have risen, pour the heavy cream over the top of the rolls, allowing it to soak into and around the rolls. 13: Bake the rolls for 20–22 minutes, until light golden brown and the center rolls are cooked through. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. 14: While the rolls are baking, make the frosting: Add the butter and cream cheese to a medium bowl. Cream with an electric hand mixer on medium speed until light and airy. Add the powdered sugar and mix on low speed to combine. Add the vanilla and mix on medium-high speed for 1–2 minutes, until the frosting is fluffy. 15: Spread the frosting over the rolls, then top with sliced almonds and more berries. 16: Enjoy!

"answer: name: scratch-croissant-donuts. ingredients:cold water (1cup)、large egg、bread flour (3 ¾cups)、kosher salt (1 ½teaspoons)、light brown sugar (¼cup)、instant yeast (1tablespoon)、unsalted butter (8tablespoons)、nonstick cooking spray . instructions: 0: Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the cold water, egg, bread flour, salt, brown sugar, yeast, and butter. Mix on medium speed until the dough comes together in a ball and begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes. 1: Use wet hands to wipe the dough from the hook and cover the bowl with a kitchen towel. Place the dough in a warm place and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. 2: Line a 9 x 13-inch baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease with nonstick spray. 3: Uncover the bowl and transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Use your hands to gently press the dough to the edges of the pan. Refrigerate until the dough is completely chilled all the way through, at least 1 hour, or up to 8 hours. If refrigerating for more than 1 hour, cover with plastic wrap to prevent the dough from drying out. 4: Make the butter block: Cut a sheet of parchment paper to measure 12 x 16 inches. Fold the edges inward to create a 7-inch square, then unfold the parchment. 5: Slice the butter lengthwise into ¼-inch-thick pieces and arrange the butter tiles in a single layer to fill the center 7-inch square of the parchment. Fold the parchment over to fully enclose the butter and let the packet sit at room temperature until slightly softened, about 30 minutes. When the butter is malleable, use a rolling pin to distribute the butter in an even layer to the edges and corners of the packet. If the butter is too soft, refrigerate the packet until it firms up, about 20 minutes.  You want the butter and the dough to have the same texture. 6: Laminate the dough: Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a very lightly floured work surface (too much flour will break the lamination, so use just enough to keep the dough from sticking to the work surface). Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a rectangle that is a little more than twice as long as the butter block, about 8 x 15 inches.  Place the butter block in the center of the dough and fold the sides of the dough over the butter to completely encase the block, gently pressing the dough together to seal. 7: Very lightly dust the rolling pin with flour and roll the dough into a square, about ¼ inch thick.  Use a pastry wheel or long, sharp knife to trim the edges so the butter is just barely exposed on all sides (trimming the edges will help make clean and even layers when folding the dough). Fold the dough in half horizontally, then fold in half vertically, making sure to line up the edges. Place the dough square back on the baking sheet and let the dough rest in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. 8: Remove the dough from the refrigerator and repeat rolling out to ¼-inch-thick square, trimming the edges, and folding one more time. Return the dough to the baking sheet and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Place the dough in the refrigerator and let rest overnight. 9: Shape the donuts: Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. 10: Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature until it is soft enough to roll without applying too much pressure, about 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a very lightly floured surface and roll into a 14-inch square. Let the dough rest for about 5 minutes to let the gluten relax. 11: Using a 3½-inch round cutter, cut out 12 rounds from the dough. Use a 1-inch round cutter to cut out the center of each dough round. Place the donuts on the prepared baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart. Lightly grease a piece of plastic wrap with nonstick spray and gently cover the pan. Let the donuts proof at room temperature until doubled in size, about 2 hours. 12: Fry the donuts: Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot fitted with a deep fry thermometer over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 350°F (180°C). Set a wire rack over a baking sheet. 13: Working in batches of 3–4 at a time, fry the donuts in the hot oil, flipping once halfway through, until golden brown all over, about 3 minutes. Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the donuts to the wire rack to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. 14: Make the icing: In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla bean seeds, and buttermilk until smooth. Transfer the icing to a small piping bag and cut a hole in the tip. 15: Pipe the icing on the top of the donuts. 16: Enjoy!

"answer: name: dairy-free-broccolini-cheddar-quiche. ingredients:Vegan Quiche Crust . instructions: 0: Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). 1: Roll out the crust on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch (25 cm) round about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick. Gently transfer the crust to a 9-inch (22 cm) pie dish. Trim any excess dough around the edges. Fold the edges of dough back underneath itself, then crimp using an index finger knuckle on one hand and the thumb and index finger on the other hand. 2: Place a piece of parchment paper in the center of the crust. Add the dried beans to the center and spread toward the sides of the crust — this will add weight to keep the crust from puffing up and hold up the walls while baking. 3: Bake the crust for 15 minutes. Carefully remove the weights by lifting out the parchment paper, then bake for 5 minutes more, until the dough no longer looks raw. Remove from the oven and let cool. 4: While the crust bakes, make the filling: Set the tofu in a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl. Let drain for 10 minutes. 5: In a large skillet, combine the water, broccolini, and ¼ teaspoon salt.

"answer: name: rainbow-pride-flag-bagels. ingredients:warm water (¼cup)、red gel food coloring (¼teaspoon)、instant yeast (¼teaspoon)、brown sugar (½teaspoon)、all purpose flour (⅔cup)、kosher salt (¼teaspoon) . instructions: 0: Make the red dough: Add the warm water and red food coloring to a medium bowl and stir until the food coloring is dissolved. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water, then add the brown sugar, flour, and salt and mix until the dough begins to come together. Use your hands to gently knead in the bowl until there are no dry spots, 1–2 minutes (the dough doesn’t need to be completely smooth at this point), then bring the dough together in a ball. Set the dough in a small dish inside a gallon-size zip-top plastic bag and seal to prevent the dough from drying out. Repeat to make the orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple doughs. After mixing the final dough, let the dough rest for 10 minutes. 1: Remove a dough ball from the bag. On a lightly floured surface, knead for 30–60 seconds, until smooth. Return the dough to the plastic bag and repeat with the remaining colors. 2: Let the dough rise in a warm spot for 40–45 minutes, until 1½ times their original size. 3: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 4: Transfer the purple dough to a lightly floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into an 8 x 6-inch rectangle. (You should need very little flour, if any, to roll the dough out.) Roll out the blue dough to an 8 x 6-inch rectangle. Place on top of the purple rectangle, making sure not to overlap the edges so that each color remains exposed. Repeat with the green, yellow, orange, and red doughs, in this order. Use your hands to stretch and flatten the stacked dough rectangle as needed to maintain the 8 x 6-inch dimensions. 5: Use a sharp knife to cut the dough lengthwise into 6 1-inch-wide strips. Return 5 of the strips to the plastic bag to prevent them from drying out. 6: Use your fingertips to lightly roll the dough strip back and forth 5–6 times to round the square edges. Once rounded, use your palms to apply light pressure, rolling the dough strip back and forth while moving outwards, until it is about 12 inches long. Grab an end of the dough strip in each hand and twist 1–2 times to swirl the colors. Bring the ends together in a ring, overlapping about 1½ inches. Press the ends together to seal. Use your palm to roll the overlapping dough against the surface to help seal, if needed. Make sure the bagel hole is at least 2 inches wide, using your fingers to carefully stretch and widen the hole if necessary. Transfer the bagel to the prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining dough strips, spacing the bagels at least 2 inches apart. Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap or place in a large, clean recycled plastic bag to prevent the bagels from drying out. Let proof for 25–30 minutes, until slightly puffy. 7: Arrange a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). 8: While the bagels are proofing, prepare the water bath: Add the water, baking soda, and flour to a large pot. Stir to dissolve the baking soda and flour. Bring the water to a boil over high heat and let boil for at least 5 minutes. 9: Carefully place 2–3 bagels (depending on the size of the pot) upside down into the boiling water. Boil for 40 seconds, flipping halfway through. Use a slotted spatula or spoon to lift the bagel out of the water, letting the excess water drip off, then transfer back to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining bagels. Let the bagels cool for 5 minutes 10: Bake the bagels for 20–22 minutes, until the bottoms are golden brown. Let cool completely before slicing. 11: Enjoy!

"answer: name: fresh-pasta-dough. ingredients:all-purpose flour (2cups)、kosher salt (1pinch)、large eggs、large egg yolks、extra virgin olive oil (1tablespoon) . instructions: 0: On a clean, sturdy work surface, turn out your chosen flour(s) and salt and make a large well in the middle with your hands. 1: Whisk the eggs, egg yolks, and olive oil together in a medium bowl until combined, then pour the mixture into the well. 2: Using the same fork, whisk the eggs, slowly incorporating more and more flour into the eggs by moving your fork along the edges of the well. 3: Once almost all of the flour is incorporated, start bringing the dough together with your hands. (The dough should be malleable, but not sticky--add more flour if the dough is sticking too much to your hands or the surface. Alternatively, if it’s too dry and tough, whisk another egg with 1 tablespoon of water and use your hand to sprinkle some of the mixture over the dough, continuing to do so until the dough is easier to knead.) 4: Knead the dough for 7-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. When you poke the dough, it should spring back. 5: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour, or until the dough does not spring back when poked. 6: Unwrap the dough and cut into 8 equal pieces so that it’s easier to work with. Take 1 piece and wrap the rest in the plastic wrap so that they don’t dry out. 7: Lightly flour your work surface, and begin rolling out the piece of dough into one long piece. Then, fold the top third down, and the bottom third over that, like a letter. Rotate the dough 90˚ and roll the piece back into a long shape. This helps form a more even rectangular shape and makes the dough a little bit easier to work with. 8: Continue rolling out the dough until it is very thin. When you lift the dough, you should be able to see your hands through it. 9: Fold the top and bottom of the rectangle to meet in the middle, then fold over again--this will make the dough easier to cut. Cut the dough to your ideal shape. Loosen or unravel the cut dough immediately, so it doesn’t stick, sprinkle with a bit of extra flour, or semolina, if using. Let the pasta sit out for about 30 minutes to dry out slightly. 10: Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and stir to ensure it doesn’t clump. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or 30 seconds to 1 minute after the pasta comes to the surface (fresh pasta will cook much faster than dried pasta!) 11: Take out a noodle and taste for doneness. Once cooked to your liking, remove the pasta from the water, being sure to save at least 1 cup (240 ML) of the pasta cooking water. 12: Add the cooked pasta into your preferred sauce and stir to coat, adding some of the reserved pasta water if needed to add a bit of body and silkiness to the sauce. 13: Enjoy!

Stir with a wooden spoon, gradually adding more and more water until the dough starts to come together. You may need a tablespoon more or less water, depending on the consistency of the dough as it forms. 2: Using your hands, ensure the dough is well incorporated, but do not knead. Be careful not to overwork the dough. 3: Cover with plastic wrap and store at room temperature overnight, or for at least 12 hours,  until doubled in size and porous. 4: Make the sauce by combining tomato paste, water, vinegar, maple syrup, salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, basil, marjoram, and cayenne pepper in a medium bowl. Let sit at room temperature for an hour before canning or jarring. Refrigerate as necessary up to 2 weeks. 5: Once the dough has risen, transfer to a clean, floured work surface and form into a large ball. Cut the dough into 6 equal parts and form dough balls by folding the corners into themselves. 6: Place the dough balls on a floured sheet pan, sprinkle with flour, and cover with a damp towel for about 30 minutes to an hour. 7: Preheat oven with a pizza stone in it to 500ªF (260ºC) or a low broil. 8: Work each dough into a disk on a floured work surface.

"answer: name: how-to-roast-a-thanksgiving-turkey. ingredients:turkey、kosher salt (½teaspoon)、unsalted butter (1cup)、fresh sage leaf (½cup)、garlic (4cloves)、dried thyme (1tablespoon)、dried rosemary (1tablespoon)、lemon、medium white onion、large carrot、celery (1stalk)、low-sodium chicken broth (32oz)、all-purpose flour (2tablespoons) . instructions: 0: Defrost the turkey. Place the wrapped turkey on a baking sheet and set on the bottom shelf of the fridge. Defrost for 1 day if fresh, or 4-5 days, if frozen. For a quicker defrost, submerge the turkey in a large sink or cooler filled with cold water and defrost for 30 minutes per pound of turkey. 1: 1 day before cooking, brine the turkey. Measure the salt into a small bowl. Set up your work station with kitchen shears, a plastic bag, a fresh baking sheet with a wire rack set over it, and a garbage can nearby. 2: Cut the packaging off the defrosted turkey, being careful not to cut the skin or flesh, and remove from the bag. Set the turkey on the baking sheet with the wire rack. Cut off any excess skin around the neck and release the plastic holder securing the legs. Remove any innards and giblets from the cavity and discard. Thoroughly pat the turkey dry with paper towels. 3: Sprinkle the salt all over the turkey, making sure to get in the cavity, under the skin, and between any crevices. 4: Refrigerate the turkey, uncovered, for 1 day. If brining for more than 1 day, cover the turkey with plastic wrap, then remove for the last day to let the skin dry out before roasting. 5: A few hours before serving, prepare the turkey for roasting. Set an oven rack at the lowest height and the other in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 325˚F (160˚C). 6: Add the butter to a medium bowl. Chop the sage leaves and add to the bowl, along with the garlic, thyme, and rosemary. Mash the herbs into the butter. Set aside. 7: Set a roasting pan or single-use aluminum pan over a baking sheet near your work station. 8: Trim off the wing tips of the turkey and add to the roasting pan. Cut off any excess skin to expose the wishbone, then use a paring knife to cut out the bone. Use your hands or kitchen shears if the bone is hard to remove. Add to the roasting pan. 9: Turn the bird so the legs are facing you. Tug out the plastic holder. Loosen the skin around the breasts, using your fingers to create a pocket. Be careful not to tear the skin. Rub the herb butter under the skin, then all over the rest of the turkey. Make sure to get in any crevices and the cavity. 10: Stuff the lemon wedges and ¼ of the onion inside the turkey cavity. Add the rest of the onion wedges to the roasting pan, along with the carrot and celery. Pour the chicken broth into the pan. 11: Use the wire rack to rest the turkey over the roasting pan, then pour any accumulated juices from the baking sheet into the pan. 12: Set the roasting pan on the lowest oven rack. Place the turkey on the wire rack on the middle oven rack, directly over the roasting pan to catch any juices. 13: Roast the turkey for about 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 160˚F (71˚C). Start checking the turkey about 90 minutes into roasting to ensure it does not overcook. 14: Remove the turkey from the oven and set the wire rack over a baking sheet to catch any juices. Let rest for about 30 minutes while the internal temperature climbs to 165˚F (74˚C). 15: Meanwhile, make the gravy: Remove any solids from the roasting pan. Strain the liquid into a large pot and bring to a boil, then let reduce to your desired consistency. The gravy can be served as is or, for a thicker gravy, ladle a few spoonfuls of stock into a small bowl with the flour. Whisk until no lumps remain, then stir a bit of the flour mixture at a time back into the pot. Return to a boil and let cook for 5 minutes, until thickened. Repeat as needed until the gravy has reached your desired consistency. Reduce the heat to low, whisking occasionally, until ready to serve, or remove from the heat and bring back to temperature before serving. 16: Carve the turkey: Transfer the turkey to a large cutting board with a lip to catch any juices. First, release the legs to make carving the rest of the bird easier. Using a sharp knife, cut along where the legs meets the breasts, being careful not to cut all the way through. Then, use your hands to pull the legs and thigh away from the carcass and tuck them under the wings to keep them in place. 17: Cut straight down along both sides of the breast bone until you can’t cut any further, then cut horizontally near the wing to release the breasts from the carcass. 18: Cut all the way through the legs to release from the hip joint. 19: Find where the shoulder meets the breast, then cut through that joint to remove the wings, using your hands to pull the wing away if the joint is tough to find. 20: Set the carcass aside--you can pick off any remaining meat for leftovers, or make stock from the whole carcass. 21: Slice the breasts crosswise, against the grain, then transfer to a serving platter. Cut the drumsticks from the thighs through the joint, wiggling the knife to find an easy release or pulling apart with your hands. Add the drumsticks to the platter. Cut the thigh meat away from the bone, then into bite-size pieces, and add to the platter. Release the flats from the wings by cutting through the joint, pulling apart with your hands if necessary, then add to the platter. 22: Rearrange the meat on the platter so the larger pieces of meat with crispy, browned skin are on top. Garnish the platter with sage leaves and lemon wedges, if desired. 23: Serve with the warm gravy. 24: Enjoy!
